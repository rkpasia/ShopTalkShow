				<description><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another Rapid Fire!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer action you&#8217;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:30">3:30</a> Do you have any rule of thumb for deciding when to use the new element (using the picturefill polyfill) vs just using CSS background images with media queries for responsive images? Is it more a question of semantics?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:15">12:15</a> What is translateZ traditionally used for and how can it help me with my front-end style markup?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:26">24:26</a> I love inline-block, it&#8217;s great and allows for easy simple vertical alignment. However it always adds that little bit of extras space making items wrap, e.g. a list of 4 with each set at 25%. Is there a better/cleaner way than commenting out the space? Why does it even happen?
<li><a href="#t=31:36">31:36</a> I&#8217;m trying to move stackicons.com from icon font to SVG-based. Can you reference an external style sheet in the SVG file itself and use that as a single place to change styling across all the icons?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:45">38:45</a> In jQuery, what is the difference between the .on function and the .click function?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:47">44:47</a> I&#8217;m curious on what your thoughts are for terminology changes across an entire project. To give you some background, I work for a company that has created a web-based software. We have come across stages in our development that we want to change the terminology for functionality in our site. How would you guys go about this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:44">51:44</a> Regarding performance on mobile, is it better to A) have all content on page load and then show-hide it, B) inject the markup and content dynamically or C) load that markup and content using ajax, when a tablet o desktop media query matches, so secondary content can be shown to these more capable browsers.</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another Rapid Fire!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer action you&#8217;ve ever heard!
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

3:30 Do you have any rule of thumb for deciding when to use the new element (using the picturefill polyfill) vs just using CSS background images with media queries for responsive images? Is it more a question of semantics?
12:15 What is translateZ traditionally used for and how can it help me with my front-end style markup?
24:26 I love inline-block, it&#8217;s great and allows for easy simple vertical alignment. However it always adds that little bit of extras space making items wrap, e.g. a list of 4 with each set at 25%. Is there a better/cleaner way than commenting out the space? Why does it even happen?
31:36 I&#8217;m trying to move stackicons.com from icon font to SVG-based. Can you reference an external style sheet in the SVG file itself and use that as a single place to change styling across all the icons?
38:45 In jQuery, what is the difference between the .on function and the .click function?
44:47 I&#8217;m curious on what your thoughts are for terminology changes across an entire project. To give you some background, I work for a company that has created a web-based software. We have come across stages in our development that we want to change the terminology for functionality in our site. How would you guys go about this?
51:44 Regarding performance on mobile, is it better to A) have all content on page load and then show-hide it, B) inject the markup and content dynamically or C) load that markup and content using ajax, when a tablet o desktop media query matches, so secondary content can be shown to these more capable browsers.

20:19 Adobe &#8211; Check out Project Parfait: it&#8217;s a really nice way to extract everything you need from a PSD &#8211; in your browser!
Also, take a look at the Edge Animage CC updates: some sweet new features like copy/paste SVG art from Illustrator.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>This week we were joined by <a href="http://kovalc.in/">Katie Kovalcin</a>. Katie is a designer at Happy Cog in Austin and teaches at Girl Develop It.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</p>
<p><a href="#t=12:55">12:55</a> <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2014/06/live-blog-google-io-protest/">Protesters outside Google.io</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5846216/other-companies-are-already-selling-google-cardboard-clones">Google Cardboard</a></p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=19:56">19:56</a> What is your feeling on website creators like Wix and Squarespace? Is this taking away from potential business for web designer/developers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:32">27:32</a> Recently I was asked to create page design for a client. Just the visual design, no code. I thought this would be easy, but after spending an hour and a half creating a table in Illustrator, I&#8217;m yearning for some basic HTML &amp; CSS.

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Katie Kovalcin. Katie is a designer at Happy Cog in Austin and teaches at Girl Develop It.
We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:
12:55 Protesters outside Google.io, and Google Cardboard
Q &#38; A:

19:56 What is your feeling on website creators like Wix and Squarespace? Is this taking away from potential business for web designer/developers?
27:32 Recently I was asked to create page design for a client. Just the visual design, no code. I thought this would be easy, but after spending an hour and a half creating a table in Illustrator, I&#8217;m yearning for some basic HTML &#38; CSS. Are there any design tools you guys know of that take into account of things like &#8220;separation of style and content&#8221; or &#8220;modular components&#8221;?
34:10 I&#8217;m a newb. I love designing using HTML and CSS, but my creativity is stunted because I can&#8217;t program. Which language should I learn first?
38:43 Responsive web design has done a lot of great things for the web, but sometimes the sharing of a single codebase for all the different breakpoints makes things tricky. I&#8217;ll usually ask my designers to avoid situations that would require building a component in two different ways across screen sizes. The navigation in the header is usually one of the areas for this discussion (where a design basically requires toggling visibility between two different menu systems). Am I being too much of a stickler or should I stand my ground?
47:03 For smaller websites I often find it difficult to collect quality content from the business that I am designing a website for. These website budgets are usually small therefore a content writer may not be practical. Can you explain your process on collecting data or steering customers in the right direction when it comes to providing quality content?
52:35 I&#8217;ve got this really bad habit of nudging things in my design. Two pixels up, an em here, an em there. And then repeat into insanity. I&#8217;m always struggling to get that whitespace just right. How do you approach whitespace?

<li><a href="#t=18:30">18:30</a> It seems like with responsive design it&#8217;s becoming acceptable to use &#8220;foreground images&#8221; (images IN the markup) as banner images so that they can be scaled down as the viewport narrows. Is this acceptable now? </li>

Q &#38; A:

1:53 How do I integrate GitHub into a real web publishing workflow?
6:40 I find typography on the web always looks somehow chunky. That&#8217;s why I use the webkit prefixed font-smoothing: antialiased on every project I work on to make it look nice and crisp at least for some users. Is there a major problem with this feature that I&#8217;ve missed or any other good reason why developers don&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t use it?
12:15 I&#8217;ve been messing around with the new Flexslider 2 Beta, and I wanted to pull photos from Flickr and use it as a responsive photo gallery. However, the layout breaks and has excessive white space when Flexslider tries to account for portrait oriented images. Is there a way to use intrinsic ratios like with FitVids to get rid of the excess white space?
18:30 It seems like with responsive design it&#8217;s becoming acceptable to use &#8220;foreground images&#8221; (images IN the markup) as banner images so that they can be scaled down as the viewport narrows. Is this acceptable now?
22:15 If you use media queries to adjust the body font-size percentage, is there any rule to figuring out the adjustments to the percentage as you go along?
26:24 What do you guys use for Style Guide Generation?
29:00 Do you guys wear pants while recording Shoptalk shows?
29:49 Any thoughts on Condoleezza Rice joining Dropbox?
30:51 Do you know any good javascript techniques to create pdf files?

				<description><![CDATA[<p>His fake name is &#8220;Earl Drudge&#8221;, an anagram of &#8220;Drug Dealer&#8221;. In early March 2014, he used some social engineering techniques and fake US federal documents to be granted full access to Chris&#8217; servers. After missing the opportunity and a failed retaliation attempt, he posted sensitive personal information of Chris&#8217; onto a site where not only can it never be removed, if it&#8217;s attempted to be removed becomes promoted.</p>
<p>He agreed to talk with Chris directly and have it recorded for this show.</p>
<p>We realize that this crosses the line of &#8220;feeding the trolls&#8221; or giving attention to &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, but we feel it relevant for our industry. Our lives and work are completely online and we&#8217;re all highly susceptible to types of hacks and identity theft. It should go without saying that you should not try to be a hero here: if you visit EarlDrudge&#8217;s site(s), try to expose his identity, or try to snoop around on him, you might actually put yourself in a position where you yourself might be vulnerable to being attacked. We advise you to simply listen.</p>
<p><strong>Update since the recording (from Chris)</strong>: I was able to talk with Media Temple directly only hours after this conversation. One good end result is that they have changed their policy of how/when/what documents can be approved in which to grant access and who can do that. The retaliation attempt (&#8220;honeypot&#8221;) was verified to have been done by Media Temple. They were trying to catch the bad guy for me, and while I wish there was better communication about that, it&#8217;s nice to know they were trying to fight back on my behalf.</p>

<li><a href="#t=17:15">17:15</a> If I set the font-weight on a parent element that doesn&#8217;t generally support text nodes (like <code>TR</code> or <code>UL</code> tags) the property can be inherited by the child <code>TD</code> or <code>LI</code>. However, if the property is set by another selector (even a less specific one), it&#8217;s replaced. What&#8217;s the deal? </li>
<li><a href="#t=26:09">26:09</a> How you organize variables for preprocessors? </li>
<li><a href="#t=32:30">32:30</a> I wanted to get your method of tackling web projects. What kind of planning goes into your personal processes? </li>
<li><a href="#t=40:05">40:05</a> I am considering getting into some collaborative development through Github. Is Github&#8217;s Explore the best place to start to find projects, or would you recommend another site for finding projects? </li>
<li><a href="#t=48:36">48:36</a> Is it semantically accurate to place pagination or breadcrumbs inside a nav element? </li>
<li><a href="#t=51:55">51:55</a> Is it a good idea to wrap function calls, which trigger Layout (consecutive read->write), in request animation frame? </li>
<li><a href="#t=56:28">56:28</a> I was wondering if you guys could talk about using ajax requests to dynamically load content on a page, and how it can be done so that google can recognize it?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &#38; answer action!
Q &#38; A:

10:00 If a freelance client wants an eCommerce solution, what is the best way to handle this?
17:15 If I set the font-weight on a parent element that doesn&#8217;t generally support text nodes (like TR or UL tags) the property can be inherited by the child TD or LI. However, if the property is set by another selector (even a less specific one), it&#8217;s replaced. What&#8217;s the deal?
26:09 How you organize variables for preprocessors?
32:30 I wanted to get your method of tackling web projects. What kind of planning goes into your personal processes?
40:05 I am considering getting into some collaborative development through Github. Is Github&#8217;s Explore the best place to start to find projects, or would you recommend another site for finding projects?
48:36 Is it semantically accurate to place pagination or breadcrumbs inside a nav element?
51:55 Is it a good idea to wrap function calls, which trigger Layout (consecutive read-&#62;write), in request animation frame?
56:28 I was wondering if you guys could talk about using ajax requests to dynamically load content on a page, and how it can be done so that google can recognize it?

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE! We take listener questions and try to answer them as best we can within a 3 minute time constraint.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

2:19 What&#8217;s the best way to release a tiny JQuery plugin?
6:14 My question is about Grunt and requireJS: if I concatenate all my javascript features into a single file, all of them will be loaded with 1 http request, right? So what&#8217;s the point of using requireJS?
13:52 What is the maximum number of javascript files that you should load on the same page?
21:02 I want to set a performance budget but have no idea where to start. Are there any good articles or pieces of advice you can give?
29:00 What&#8217;s the best way to learn JQuery?
31:35 What&#8217;s the best way to detect if something is visible in the browser&#8217;s active viewport?
38:29 Do you know of a port of Bootstrap that is more intended for a Grunt and Sass workflow?
41:50 I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out the right way to handle content hiding. Any advice or thoughts on this?
48:20 How do you handle a boss that gets upset when you ask him about which devices we&#8217;ll be supporting for a project?
51:20 Do you guys know of any cool sites/tools to see what percentage of people are currently using what browsers to get a general idea of global usage on a particular browser version?

				<description><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! We take listener questions and try to answer them as best we can within a 3 minute time constraint.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:07">3:07</a> HTML email is super fun to design for, so I&#8217;m a little surprised that you guys aren&#8217;t all about it, and kinda put it down in show 12. The demographic I design for love their email and I&#8217;m sure they will until they retire (obviously older crowd, but still relevant).</li>
<li><a href="#t=6:39">6:39</a> How do you know when to scale up and get bigger clients and start charging more? Do I need to look like an agency? Do I need a team?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:52">9:52</a> In my mind, CMS&#8217;s are too often an annoying, unnecessary layer between the developer/designer and the code, making it harder instead of easier to optimize and maintain. What are some good alternatives for sites that aren&#8217;t e-commerce or blogs?</li>
<li><a href="#t=16:08">16:08</a> Flexible grid vs multiple fixed width layouts. Pros, cons, love, hate?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:05">21:05</a> Do you think there will ever come a day when the browser makers agree to standardize so we could not have to worry about putting all the browser prefixes in, then for IE, change how we write it completely? Also if this day ever came, how big would the party be?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:17">25:17</a> My questions are: 1. Is Code Ignitor a good solution for learning the proper PHP way to import images and data from external sources? 2. What&#8217;s the best way to do this without dozens of server requests for each site view? 3. I&#8217;m planning on just reformatting the data with CSS. I want to make compelling infographics from the data. Recommendations?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:37">32:37</a> Are there any really good introductions out there to CSS preprocessors? </li>
<li><a href="#t=36:28">36:28</a> How do you work with Boilerplate?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:34">40:34</a> Now that Retina is officially coming to the laptop experience, I&#8217;m bracing myself for dealing with having to output design and development mockups at twice the resolution. How do you guys streamline production when taking differing <em>scale</em> resolutions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:02">47:02</a> Which responsive grid system do you prefer?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:07">50:07</a> How do you center a responsive website?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:17">55:17</a> What effect is the template market having on young developers who are trying to go it alone? Is it lowering client cost expectations but raising their deliverable requirement?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! We take listener questions and try to answer them as best we can within a 3 minute time constraint.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

3:07 HTML email is super fun to design for, so I&#8217;m a little surprised that you guys aren&#8217;t all about it, and kinda put it down in show 12. The demographic I design for love their email and I&#8217;m sure they will until they retire (obviously older crowd, but still relevant).
6:39 How do you know when to scale up and get bigger clients and start charging more? Do I need to look like an agency? Do I need a team?
9:52 In my mind, CMS&#8217;s are too often an annoying, unnecessary layer between the developer/designer and the code, making it harder instead of easier to optimize and maintain. What are some good alternatives for sites that aren&#8217;t e-commerce or blogs?
16:08 Flexible grid vs multiple fixed width layouts. Pros, cons, love, hate?
21:05 Do you think there will ever come a day when the browser makers agree to standardize so we could not have to worry about putting all the browser prefixes in, then for IE, change how we write it completely? Also if this day ever came, how big would the party be?
25:17 My questions are: 1. Is Code Ignitor a good solution for learning the proper PHP way to import images and data from external sources? 2. What&#8217;s the best way to do this without dozens of server requests for each site view? 3. I&#8217;m planning on just reformatting the data with CSS. I want to make compelling infographics from the data. Recommendations?
32:37 Are there any really good introductions out there to CSS preprocessors?
36:28 How do you work with Boilerplate?
40:34 Now that Retina is officially coming to the laptop experience, I&#8217;m bracing myself for dealing with having to output design and development mockups at twice the resolution. How do you guys streamline production when taking differing scale resolutions?
47:02 Which responsive grid system do you prefer?
50:07 How do you center a responsive website?
55:17 What effect is the template market having on young developers who are trying to go it alone? Is it lowering client cost expectations but raising their deliverable requirement?

<li><a href="#t=27:04">27:04</a> I&#8217;m curious to know how we as a community are handling touch events on mobile devices at the moment? Specifically referring to dropdown/fly-out menus. Is there a popular jQuery/JS library you&#8217;d recommend?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:15">35:15</a> Every now and then, my job requires me to code an html email template. I usually have to look online to see what email clients can and can&#8217;t handle, but lately I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of contradictory answers. Is there a CanIUse.com for emails?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:05">40:05</a> Is it possible to (and how can one) avoid code redundancy / DRY violations when supporting non-media query browsers like IE8 and below during responsive design implementation?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:37">50:37</a> Can you explain a bit about what Compass is, how to use it, and what makes it so great?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:34">58:34</a> What are the benefits of having a responsive design vs a separate mobile site? </li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Lyza Danger Gardner.
We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

12:33 Web Standards Killed The HTML Star, and Is Web Design Dead?
21:40 Grunt is dead? What about Gulp?

Q &#38; A:

27:04 I&#8217;m curious to know how we as a community are handling touch events on mobile devices at the moment? Specifically referring to dropdown/fly-out menus. Is there a popular jQuery/JS library you&#8217;d recommend?
35:15 Every now and then, my job requires me to code an html email template. I usually have to look online to see what email clients can and can&#8217;t handle, but lately I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of contradictory answers. Is there a CanIUse.com for emails?
40:05 Is it possible to (and how can one) avoid code redundancy / DRY violations when supporting non-media query browsers like IE8 and below during responsive design implementation?
50:37 Can you explain a bit about what Compass is, how to use it, and what makes it so great?
58:34 What are the benefits of having a responsive design vs a separate mobile site?

<li><a href="#t=25:03">25:03</a> Just wondered what approach you guys take to testing your sites. Not just design, but also functionality and calculations etc. Do you write tests or use any nice tools?</li>

<li><a href="#t=42:40">42:40</a> I have been a web developer for 4 years and I recently built a site for a client that is by far the worst I have built in my career.

<li><a href="#t=51:00">51:00</a> I would like to get your opinion and thoughts on how to better interact with other developers who either don&#8217;t care or don&#8217;t have an understanding for why and how you have laid out your markup the way you have.</li>
<li><a href="#t=57:05">57:05</a> What is the best responsive solution for image/video galleries? I need my work to be easily accessible on mobile. My problem is that most websites use lightboxes and this seems outdated now. What are your opinions?</li>

Q &#38; A:

16:37 My company&#8217;s IT department has taken over our website. What can I do about it?
25:03 Just wondered what approach you guys take to testing your sites. Not just design, but also functionality and calculations etc. Do you write tests or use any nice tools?
32:55 Will Macaw (and similar tools) replace web designers?
42:40 I have been a web developer for 4 years and I recently built a site for a client that is by far the worst I have built in my career. Should I intentionally ignore best practices just because the client doesn&#8217;t understand and wants the web to work like it did in 2001?
51:00 I would like to get your opinion and thoughts on how to better interact with other developers who either don&#8217;t care or don&#8217;t have an understanding for why and how you have laid out your markup the way you have.
57:05 What is the best responsive solution for image/video galleries? I need my work to be easily accessible on mobile. My problem is that most websites use lightboxes and this seems outdated now. What are your opinions?

		<itunes:summary>This week, it&#8217;s another RAPID FIRE!!! Chris and Dave take on listener questions, fast and furious.

2:27 Do you guys have any advice when the time comes to hand over a WordPress site?
5:57 What are your opinions about disabilities (hopefully about stuttering but not necessary) in the workplace?
9:06 How do I address responsiveness on items that don&#8217;t scale well (table, video embeds)?
14:15 What is Grunt.js? What do I use it for?
17:37 I was wondering what your opinions are on training from places like MakerSquare (in Austin), G-School (in Denver) and others that say they can teach you to become a developer in a relatively short amount of time. Would you consider attending schools like these?
21:14 I&#8217;m looking to start a video blog and I&#8217;m searching for a CMS to use with my static site which I designed and developed. Do you have any experience or thoughts about Leaf CMS?
25:17 Lately I&#8217;ve just been frustrated with all the work needed to make WordPress speedy. The Admin Dashboard in particular can be so slow at times. Any hot tips to make WordPress snappy?
28:35 So we&#8217;ve just launched a startup, what&#8217;s the best way for us to get the app / platform out there, and get people using it?
34:28 I am yet a CSE undergrad student. I like both C++ and CSS. I like native programming and front end programming. Will I have to choose one or can I do both?
37:56 What are your opinions about Oracle ADF?
42:00 Does it make sense to use sprites in your workflow when your image folder is broken up into 2 or more sub folders?
44:40 Could you talk a bit about Custom Elements (web components) and why they are (or aren&#8217;t) a good idea? Won&#8217;t they dilute the semantic value of already existing elements such as &#60;header&#62; and &#60;footer&#62;?
48:20 Have you investigated switching your local development to AMPPS? I know you have been a big MAMP Pro fan, but I&#8217;ve been reading that it&#8217;s stale and AMPPS has a lot of activity. Thoughts?
52:31 It&#8217;s 2013. What&#8217;s up with with setting type in pixels, ems and rems, or even %. I understand the differences in theory, but in practice, I really only use pixels.

7:00 Webkit hates src-N

End Of Year Responsive Images Report

17:20 Learn jQuery from Scratch (CSS-Tricks Class)

Q &#38; A:

21:15 Is it worth taking the time to learn Flash in 2013?
26:56 Is getting a degree from a university something that you feel is a necessity for our line of work or is there enough value in self teaching the skills used in web development?
33:54 Can you give a general overview of the things someone new to the field should study right away to build their core coding skills?
39:57 StackOverflow and books can only teach me so much. What are your recommendations for code mentoring both at work and when I freelance? I never know if I am doing things the &#8220;right&#8221; way.
48:32 As someone just starting out in web design, should I be using Flexbox right now?
52:23 I&#8217;ve been designing and developing for a couple years and just moved into WordPress. I stumbled upon the editor that allows you to edit the templates and CSS and I wonder if its a good idea to do edits here or continue to edit the files from the FTP?
56:12 I don&#8217;t do any coding, I solely focus on web design. Can I use a robust, well-maintained Behance/Dribble profile instead of building a separate portfolio site? Will potential employers look down on me if I decide to go in that direction?

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Karen McGrane. Karen is a mobile content strategist and has a fantastic book called Content Strategy for Mobile.
We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

24:08 Front End Architechture Showdown CSS Cargo Cult
25:19 Does our Industry have a Drinking Problem?
29:34 Scroll Hijacking

Q &#38; A:

34:56 Why does no one talk about RWD in the opposite direction, making things bigger for larger screens?
40:50 Have you really heard Google say they&#8217;ll punish non-mobile-optimized sites?
48:04 I work for a small traditional advertising and marketing agency. We are often finding that clients are not fully understanding our project proposals and specs from the wireframes and spec we present. Some approve the wireframes then want to change core functionality or design features after development has started. Any advice on how to handle this?
53:00 What is your opinion on websites that use large sliders on the landing page? Do you feel this is a waste of website real estate or a powerful instrument to convey a idea?

<li><a href="#t=27:06">27:06</a> I have a quick question about redesigning my portfolio. I have big plans for using the canvas element which isn’t supported in IE8-. Would it be a waste of time for me to provide fallback images for IE8 users?</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:22">29:22</a> We build our clients websites in WordPress. One thing we don’t do is bake in support/on going maintenance for our clients sites in our contracts. What are your 2cents on support plans/updating sites? Should we be charging and ongoing service fee to make sure the security on our clients sites don’t become vulnerable?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:46">36:46</a> I’m working on learning Git and how to best utilize Github. Should Github should become part of my regular workflow or instead just a backup of my code and a place to share and collaborate with others.</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:08">42:08</a> Here’s my question: What’s the deal with Art Direction? What role does Art Direction play in your work?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:42">51:42</a> I keep reading things like “get a mentor” or “have your code reviewed”, yet I’ve never been able to find anyone interested in doing either of those. Any idea how it’s possible to find that kind of people, or why people keep saying that if they don’t exist?</li>

36:46 I’m working on learning Git and how to best utilize Github. Should Github should become part of my regular workflow or instead just a backup of my code and a place to share and collaborate with others.
42:08 Here’s my question: What’s the deal with Art Direction? What role does Art Direction play in your work?
51:42 I keep reading things like “get a mentor” or “have your code reviewed”, yet I’ve never been able to find anyone interested in doing either of those. Any idea how it’s possible to find that kind of people, or why people keep saying that if they don’t exist?

				<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time for another RAPIDFIRE! No news, no drama, just lots of question and answer action.</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=0:51">0:51</a> How do you prefer ordering your queries within your stylesheet? Is mobile-first really the best strategy here?</li>
<li><a href="#t=8:27">8:27</a> Would either of you have any insights as to how to test, target, and develop for the stock &#8220;Internet&#8221; browser app from Android?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:37">12:37</a> Maybe <a href="https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> will be useful to your podcast listeners?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:45">19:45</a> Is there a pretty CSS only solution to style a file input field? The default is so ugly and annoying.</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:00">24:00</a> I have noticed that many theme developers will have the header template that opens a div that is closed in the page template. I find this very frustrating. Is this common for wordpress or is this a bad idea all together?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:12">28:12</a> So I&#8217;ve been having a habitual debate between the SEO department at my job, as well with my other developers, which is the usage of h1&#8217;s per page. I understand it use to be that we were suppose to use only one h1 per page for SEO purposes, however from my understanding with html5 elements like section and article we can now use multiple h1&#8217;s per page. With many conflicting articles out there, and all these SEO ranking tools that contradict one another, what&#8217;s the deal here?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:10">36:10</a> I was wondering if you could explain the difference between web designers, front end developers, UI designers, etc.?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:22">40:22</a> A lot of the development I do these days is responsive, but in order to accommodate advertising or Facebook widgets etc I am finding that working with a fixed width sidebar is cleanest. I have been experimenting with display:table-cell, it looked like the perfect solution until I had a page that had a series of short pieces of content that didn&#8217;t keep the left hand area full width (<a href="http://codepen.io/mtedwards/pen/ILkzy">example here</a> Is there a way around this? Do I really just need to wait for Flexbox? Any advice would be awesome.</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:17">43:17</a> I&#8217;ve started working with Rails and the Rails asset pipeline. One thing I don&#8217;t like is that Rails does the Sass compiling instead of doing it via command line or with a tool like Codekit. I was wondering if you guys know if there are any benefits to using the pipeline vs just compiling it locally. Finally, what do your Sass file structure look like? Do you have one manifest file with many imports, or multiple files each with their own imports?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:34">51:34</a> Hey guys, I am curious if you guys are familiar with Codekit&#8217;s KIT language?</li>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>This week we were joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/flomotlik">Florian Motlik</a>. Flo is an awesome programmer an a co-founder of <a href="https://www.codeship.io/">Codeship</a>, a part of <a href="http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/boston/">Techstars Boston</a>. This episode is a deep dive into continuous deployment and automation.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=13:08">13:08</a> I would like to use Git for version control, and set up a deployment strategy so I can stop going &#8220;FTP commando’, but terminal is a bit scary for me. Do you have any suggestions for free or one-off-purchase alternatives for deployment so I can get off FTP?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:50">20:50</a> Hey guys, I just did a little google-ing and found an <a href="http://www.stephenradford.me/blog/tutorials/deploy-via-bitbucket-or-github-service-hooks">FTP-post-commit-deploy-script for Bitbucket/Github</a>. It works on public and private repos. I set it up on my server for a little project I’m working on, and so far it’s working great! I thought this could be a good tool for folks that don’t have a VPS they can setup Git on to still get on a version control work flow.</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:40">22:40</a> What’s the best way to handle database synching? Is it possible to do it with version control?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:09">40:09</a> I have this site to build with about 30 pages, all one template. Where the line is drawn for static sites vs. CMS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:27">52:27</a> I have been looking at several PaaS options out there such as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://www.appfog.com/">Appfog</a>, <a href="https://pagodabox.com/">Paogdabox</a>, and <a title="Fort Rabit" href="http://fortrabbit.com/" target="_blank">Fortrabbit</a>. I was wondering if those types of scalable web application platforms are best used for all types of sites (blogs for example) since they provide a level of control and scalability, or are they really just meant to be utilized on custom web applications that do a lot of processing server side?</li>

We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A

13:08 I would like to use Git for version control, and set up a deployment strategy so I can stop going &#8220;FTP commando’, but terminal is a bit scary for me. Do you have any suggestions for free or one-off-purchase alternatives for deployment so I can get off FTP?
20:50 Hey guys, I just did a little google-ing and found an FTP-post-commit-deploy-script for Bitbucket/Github. It works on public and private repos. I set it up on my server for a little project I’m working on, and so far it’s working great! I thought this could be a good tool for folks that don’t have a VPS they can setup Git on to still get on a version control work flow.
22:40 What’s the best way to handle database synching? Is it possible to do it with version control?
40:09 I have this site to build with about 30 pages, all one template. Where the line is drawn for static sites vs. CMS?
52:27 I have been looking at several PaaS options out there such as Heroku, Appfog, Paogdabox, and Fortrabbit. I was wondering if those types of scalable web application platforms are best used for all types of sites (blogs for example) since they provide a level of control and scalability, or are they really just meant to be utilized on custom web applications that do a lot of processing server side?

				<description><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE! We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:23">2:23</a> I recently ran the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation</a> tool on one of my WordPress site. I was amazed to see how many errors came up&#8230; Do you have any suggestions for validating my markup?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:19">9:19</a> Should I learn <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> or <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> to speed up writing HTML?</li>
<li><a href="#t=14:47">14:47</a> Do you know of any good tutorials or resources that explain how to set up a workflow for WordPress using GitHub for version control? (Yes: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/">The Lodge</a> at <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="http://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/?utm_source=shoptalkshow.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=shoptalkshowad">WP Migrate DB Pro</a>)</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:40">23:40</a> I was wondering if you know of a way to synchronize break points values between different assets? Is there a way to set the breakpoint values in some way so that both Sass and JS can load them in and use them?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:45">27:45</a> Whenever I use SVGs as a <code>background-image</code> and add the <code>background-size</code> property, the SVG in Firefox is blurry. I&#8217;ve tried fixing this several ways, including making the width and height of the SVG 100%, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to work in every case. Have you ever run into this problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:48">30:48</a> Do you follow any specific style guides for personal/team coding? (<a href="http://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/">Yes: Sass Style Guide</a>)</li>

<li><a href="#t=39:48">39:48</a> I was wondering if you had any advice for what should go into every .htaccess file &#8211; do you have a standard that gets put into every project? I heard some talk about the one included in the HTML5 boilerplate, and took a look, but a lot of it didn&#8217;t really mean anything to me, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what to take&#8230;or should I just take it all?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:32">46:32</a> I have a question for you: What is the best way to create column layouts in CSS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:15">56:15</a> In order to use em and rem better, I declare <code>html {font-size: 62.5%;}</code> so that the root size is 10px. This allows me to do mathematical calculations much easier and faster. (For eg., a 15px font size can be declared as font-size: 1.5rem;). However, this doesn&#8217;t work when it comes to using <code>em</code> in media queries. I&#8217;ve noticed that for these to work correctly, I have to revert back to the default 16px. So a <code>min-width: 1000px</code> will be the inconsistent <code>min-width: 62.5em</code> instead of 100em. Do you guys know of a fix for this? Should I even be using em for media queries?</li>
<li><a href="#t=61:35">61:35</a> In one of your previous episodes you talked a little about <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx</a>, and I was hoping you could talk more about that. In the little that I read, it seems like it&#8217;s much faster than Apache. But are there any catches? Or is it a no-brainer to switch from Apache?</li>
<li><a href="#t=66:56">66:56</a> Could you talk about using Normalize with Compass on Sass? What is your workflow for getting started?</li>

<li><a href="#t=6:54">6:54</a> SCSS feels complicated, and LESS seems to be enough for me. Why SCSS and not LESS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=10:31">10:31</a> Any way to avoid using PNG fallbacks for SVG images?</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:40">13:40</a> What do you think about the List Apart re-design and the drastic navigation change?</li>
<li><a href="#t=18:50">18:50</a> I’m getting tons of spam comments on my WordPress sites. Can you recommend third party comment systems like Discus?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:15">24:15</a> How can I convert long-hand CSS into short-hand CSS and minify the code?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:18">27:18</a> How much of a difference do the servers have on website response time?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we have a special RAPIDFIRE episode for you! We’re gonna answer as many of your questions as possible, as best as we can (in three minutes or less)! We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A

2:50 I’m trying to think about mobile first. Is serving HTML content through JavaScript bad? Can I serve HTML images through CSS backgrounds?
6:54 SCSS feels complicated, and LESS seems to be enough for me. Why SCSS and not LESS?
10:31 Any way to avoid using PNG fallbacks for SVG images?
13:40 What do you think about the List Apart re-design and the drastic navigation change?
18:50 I’m getting tons of spam comments on my WordPress sites. Can you recommend third party comment systems like Discus?
24:15 How can I convert long-hand CSS into short-hand CSS and minify the code?
27:18 How much of a difference do the servers have on website response time?
31:10 I’m a 16 year old designer/dev, is college worth the money?
34:34 Do you have a rule of thumb for using base64 and data URI images in your CSS?
37:00 What do you think about HTML5 Video?
42:15 What plugins do you use for common UI elements?
45:40 What are your thoughts about social media icons? Can I use my own custom icons?
48:17 How do you decide which tool to use to make a background? Should I use Photoshop, or CSS instead?
52:12 Is there a way to have a fluid width pseudo element image?
53:47 What do you think about having a video playing in the background of my site (in terms of UX)?

Do you use CSS3 selectors? (not just properties)
Is inline-block better than floats?
Concerning animations and techy graphic formats like SVG and Canvas, is the line between developer and designer blurring even more?
Does the advice for young folks getting into the industry apply to those north of 35?

		<itunes:summary>This is a classic RAPIDFIRE episode. No guests, no drama, no news, just straight question on answer action. We talk about (roughly in order):

What is the best way to host videos behind a pay wall? Chris uses WordPress with Restrict Content Pro (with PayPal) and Vimeo Pro to host the video.
Can there be cross-browser problems with PHP?
Tips for designers working with developers.
Do target="_blank" links affect SEO or UX? When should we use them?
Is it better to base breakpoints after known device sizes or the design itself?
How the text fade out effect on Polygon.com was done.
How is it possible icon fonts show up in Firefox but not Chrome?
Why does Prototype still exist?
Plug for Color My Sass by Richard Bray.
What is the correct semantics for testimonial quote with source? (Not &#60;cite&#62;, apparently)

		<itunes:summary>Another RAPIDFIRE episode of ShopTalk! No guests, no #hotdrama, no news, just all steaming hot question on answer action. We talk about (roughly in order):

(2:07) How can you minify CSS when you use WordPress? WordPress needs a special block of comments at the top of the CSS file for the theme to work.
(6:18) What do we need ems for? What is the payoff?
(15:20) How we can create equal height div with only css?
(22:42) What internet security software do we use for Mac?
(26:46) Is there a way to style individual letters of a string with just CSS?
(29:54) How do you integrate GitHub into a real web publishing workflow?
(39:13) A client wants to hide page titles in WordPress. Isn’t that bad SEO?
(40:32) Understanding the purpose behind data-* attributes in HTML5.
(47:44) Are frameworks just not for me, or am I missing the point?

		<itunes:summary>This week we are joined by Estelle Weyl. Estelle is a contract front end design engineer who has worked with a long list of big name companies. She has written a number of tech books, working on several more, and speaks at dozens of conferences a year. We talk about (roughly in order):
News&#8217;n&#8217;Links&#8217;n&#8217;Drama

FontPrep &#8211; Like the Font Squirrel @font-face generator on a Mac app you run locally.
Twitter API 1.1 Changes &#8211; #hotdrama
Picture element (Florian&#8217;s Compromise) now in dev specs.

Q &#38; A

The type attribute and links &#8211; could browsers affect request headers and thus the content served from the same URL?
Do websites using the .mobi TLD render differently on iOS? (We say on the show probably not, but&#8230;)
What is Flexbox actually doing to do for us, on a practical level?
How can we get client approval when they are constantly throwing up road blocks and steamrolling good designs?
What does &#8220;Front End Web Developer&#8221; actually mean? Do they need to know back end stuff as well?
