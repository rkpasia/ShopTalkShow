<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &amp; answer action.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:25">2:25</a> With this trend of big background images and full with slider, which size of images do you recommend to have a balance between size and weight? </li>
<li><a href="#t=7:56">7:56</a> What&#8217;s the best way to handle SVGs?</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:37">23:37</a> Why don&#8217;t browsers just include various versions of jquery within the end user machine, loading it as they encounter usage?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:36">27:36</a> You&#8217;ve mentioned Harvest as a tool for time-tracking and invoicing; are there any other tools you would suggest, specifically for expense tracking?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:36">36:36</a> What do all of you think of Netflix disabling the developer console in Chrome? Will this become popular in the future? Is it unethical?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:35">40:35</a> Inline-block grid systems won&#8217;t render correctly in Safari 7. It works fine on Safari 6, ffox and Chrome but fails miserably on Safari 7. Any solutions or advice?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:50">43:50</a> I have recently started to do some freelance web design, I am confident in my pricing however when writing up emails to a potential client giving them an estimate I feel that there is room for improvement. How does Dave/Paravel approach this, do you send some kind of template or something else?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:25">49:25</a> Going back to something raised in podcast #103 about getting server-side variables into javascript, what is the most pure way of putting server-side data into javascript?</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:37">54:37</a> I&#8217;m curious how you manage passwords when working with clients. How do you securely send passwords to clients?</li>
<li><a href="#t=59:19">59:19</a> I&#8217;m in my 40&#8242;s and to be honest, agencies are looking for people on their 20&#8242;s. Is this web design world a place for only youngsters?</li>
