<p>This week we are joined by Joe Casabona. Joe is a web developer, author and teacher at University of Scranton.</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=23:14">23:14</a> I&#8217;m starting to take my sites performance more seriously and I&#8217;m having great success compressing and caching everything, except when it comes to &#8220;defer parsing for javascript&#8221; for both internal and external resources. I&#8217;ve been reading up on it but since I don&#8217;t know javascript that well I&#8217;m having a hard time implementing. Currently I enqueue the scripts in the footer (wordpress), but apparently thats not enough.</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:21">30:21</a> I want to move from static sites to building wordpress sites. What&#8217;s the best way to transition?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:10">35:10</a> When I design websites for clients, I almost always work with wordpress. One reason is that wordpress is so widely used. Can you recommend any CMSs that are worth checking out that specifically have a similar widespread use and staying power?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:53">40:53</a> I&#8217;m thinking about more seriously getting into freelance work. What would you say are the most important skill sets?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:50">45:50</a> A deployment strategy is pretty much required for something like Ruby on Rails, where you&#8217;re precompiling assets, restarting servers, etc., but what about wordpress? What do you do about databases, plugins, or version control?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:00">55:00</a> Why has the html email section of the web not been talked about in the web standards? Is this something that I should start evangelizing about fixing or has someone already been heading this fight? What are some free / cheap solutions to check my email code cross platform?</li>
</ul>
