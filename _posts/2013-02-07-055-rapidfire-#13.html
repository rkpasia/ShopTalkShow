<p>This week is just Dave and Chris answering as many listener questions as possible. That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s RAPIDFIRE time! rat-a-tat-tat. We talk about (roughly in order):</p>
<ul>
<li>What do we think of <a href="http://getkirby.com/">Kirby CMS</a>?</li>
<li>Do we use Compass too? Are there Compass specific plugins?</li>
<li>Can you change a Sass variable depending on the media query?</li>
<li>Is it possible to find unused CSS selectors?</li>
<li>Do you ever use &#8220;inherit&#8221; as a value?</li>
<li>If you use Sass too much, will you forget CSS?</li>
<li>How do you explain to a client that you don&#8217;t know how to do something?</li>
<li>What are the key do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for a contract?</li>
</ul>
