title: '127: With Tobias Günther'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Tobias Günther. Tobias is the founder and CEO of Fournova, the makers of Tower &#8211; the most powerful Git client for Mac. We take a deep dive into Git and version control.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=16:06">16:06</a> I have never used git before as a web developer/designer. Can you explain in more detail about how git works?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:12">21:12</a> When you make a commit in a VCS like Git or Subversion, should the commit message be in the past, present or future tense?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:44">24:44</a> I am part of a very small team prototyping a new app. We are familiar with GitHub, but the enterprise-company we&#8217;re working for requires us to work in Subversion (SVN). How would you recommend we attack the SVN dilemma?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:32">32:32</a> We have a linux-based server where some of our clients&#8217; websites are hosted. Someone thought of the idea of moving the entire website-folder into a Dropbox-folder thus keeping all the websites constantly backed up to the cloud, and at the same time using the Dropbox built-in version history to easily revert back to older versions of images/files or whatever when needed. Any ideas about pros/cons regarding performance and so on?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:06">40:06</a> What license &#8211; if any &#8211; do you guys use for open source software?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:10">45:10</a> I recently wrote and open-sourced a &#8220;framework&#8221; of sorts which deploys WordPress projects via Git/GitHub using Capistrano and WP-CLI. <a href="https://github.com/Mixd/wp-deploy">Here&#8217;s the link</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:00">52:00</a> Have you tried using Git as a project management tool? Would you recommend it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=57:05">57:05</a> Do you know of an ebook, online resource, or online course directed at Git newbies?</li>
</ul>
