title: '046: RAPIDFIRE #12'
---

<p>This is a classic RAPIDFIRE episode. No guests, no drama, no news, just straight question on answer action. We talk about (roughly in order):</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the best way to host videos behind a pay wall? Chris uses WordPress with <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> (with PayPal) and <a href="http://vimeo.com/pro">Vimeo Pro</a> to host the video.</li>
<li>Can there be cross-browser problems with PHP?</li>
<li>Tips for designers working with developers.</li>
<li>Do <code>target="_blank"</code> links affect SEO or UX? When should we use them?</li>
<li>Is it better to base breakpoints after known device sizes or the design itself?</li>
<li>How the text fade out effect on <a href="http://www.polygon.com/">Polygon.com</a> was done.</li>
<li>How is it possible icon fonts show up in Firefox but not Chrome?</li>
<li>Why does <a href="http://prototypejs.org/download/">Prototype</a> still exist?</li>
<li>Plug for <a href="http://richbray.me/cms/">Color My Sass</a> by Richard Bray.</li>
<li>What is the correct semantics for testimonial quote with source? (Not <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element">&lt;cite&gt;</a>, apparently)</li>
</ul>
