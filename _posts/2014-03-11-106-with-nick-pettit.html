title: '106: With Nick Pettit'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Nick Pettit, educator at Treehouse, an online learning platform. We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=17:25">17:25</a> Correction regarding Drupal and 1000 script/style files.</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:10">20:10</a> Github releases <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, a hackable text editor</li>
</ul>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=23:29">23:29</a> I&#8217;m curious about making the shift from HTML, CSS, jQuery, WordPress development to Full Stack JS. It seems the front end world is making a huge shift in that direction, and I thought it would be a good career move for me to do one of these 8 week bootcamps to get me started. What do you guys think?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:24">30:24</a> I considered myself pretty versed in HTML, CSS, but with a desire to learn more particularly Javascript and it&#8217;s connection to CSS for dynamic website building. I feel that if I add this skill it could change a lot things for me professional. How can a service like Treehouse help me put it all together?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:15">39:15</a> I&#8217;ve been learning Ruby for the past 2 months and have now started learning Rails v4. My problem: I&#8217;m using Treehouse and they use Rails 3. What kind of issues should expect?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:08">46:08</a> This summer I&#8217;ll start trying to find some paid projects to do and I was wondering: what is best way to get the client set up with hosting and domain?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:47">50:47</a> I would love for you guys to talk a little bit about Content Editable. I work on the project <a href="getbarley.com">Barley</a> and have learned a lot about CE over the past year and it has been a painful process. There is not many resources out there so it has been mostly trial and error.</li>
