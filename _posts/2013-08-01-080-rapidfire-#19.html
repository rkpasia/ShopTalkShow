<p>It&#8217;s time for another RAPIDFIRE! We talk about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:30">2:30</a> Which books would you recommend learning about CSS and /or UX design?</li>
<li><a href="#t=6:32">6:32</a> There is a lot of hype around the Hammer and Mixture static site generators right now. Can teams work on these together, or are they just made for prototyping?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:00">12:00</a> What is the best payment gateway (ease of use and flexibility in their API) for processing both credit cards AND ACH debits?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:10">19:10</a> What do you do about supporting older browsers like IE6?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:10">24:10</a> Do you guys experience any wrist pain working at the computer so often?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:40">28:40</a> How do you deal with this inconsistency across browsers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:40">37:40</a> What are your thoughts on Stylus and the ease/difficulty of switching (from SCSS)?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:42">42:42</a> What are the most important steps a person should take to secure their WordPress sites?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:30">48:30</a> This question is related to a post that Chris wrote on CSS-Tricks where he was exploring the pros and cons of object literal javascript patterns. Should there be a standard set to all shapes and sizes of sites, or would a large site with a team of people working on it have a different JS pattern than a small one?</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:27">54:27</a> Any tips on how to use the figure element in a more elegant way than just before or after a paragraph?</li>
</ul>
