</ul>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=32:48">32:48</a> I&#8217;m currently not working in a team environment but am wondering if it would be more difficult if a developer was using the heck out of @extend? </li>
<li><a href="#t=37:22">37:22</a> Can&#8217;t we agree that it&#8217;s best to let the browser read plain CSS but let us have tools to make writing that CSS as easy and maintainable as possible? </li>
<li><a href="#t=44:02">44:02</a> How to I pull down client changes from my live wordpress site to my local environment? </li>
<li><a href="#t=50:01">50:01</a> I&#8217;m a WordPress Developer and I&#8217;ve noticed a disturbing trend lately. More and more clients are wanting developers that are experts with a specific commercial them? Weird, right? </li>
<li><a href="#t=54:05">54:05</a> I have yet to make the leap to SASS or LESS. Does it become troublesome and inconvenient to work with people and projects that don&#8217;t use these new methods?</li>
