title: '122: With Katie Kovalcin'
---

<p>This week we were joined by <a href="http://kovalc.in/">Katie Kovalcin</a>. Katie is a designer at Happy Cog in Austin and teaches at Girl Develop It.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</p>
<p><a href="#t=12:55">12:55</a> <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2014/06/live-blog-google-io-protest/">Protesters outside Google.io</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5846216/other-companies-are-already-selling-google-cardboard-clones">Google Cardboard</a></p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=19:56">19:56</a> What is your feeling on website creators like Wix and Squarespace? Is this taking away from potential business for web designer/developers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:32">27:32</a> Recently I was asked to create page design for a client. Just the visual design, no code. I thought this would be easy, but after spending an hour and a half creating a table in Illustrator, I&#8217;m yearning for some basic HTML &amp; CSS. Are there any design tools you guys know of that take into account of things like &#8220;separation of style and content&#8221; or &#8220;modular components&#8221;?</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:10">34:10</a> I&#8217;m a newb. I love designing using HTML and CSS, but my creativity is stunted because I can&#8217;t program. Which language should I learn first?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:43">38:43</a> Responsive web design has done a lot of great things for the web, but sometimes the sharing of a single codebase for all the different breakpoints makes things tricky. I&#8217;ll usually ask my designers to avoid situations that would require building a component in two different ways across screen sizes. The navigation in the header is usually one of the areas for this discussion (where a design basically requires toggling visibility between two different menu systems). Am I being too much of a stickler or should I stand my ground?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:03">47:03</a> For smaller websites I often find it difficult to collect quality content from the business that I am designing a website for. These website budgets are usually small therefore a content writer may not be practical. Can you explain your process on collecting data or steering customers in the right direction when it comes to providing quality content?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:35">52:35</a> I&#8217;ve got this really bad habit of nudging things in my design. Two pixels up, an em here, an em there. And then repeat into insanity. I&#8217;m always struggling to get that whitespace just right. How do you approach whitespace?</li>
</ul>
