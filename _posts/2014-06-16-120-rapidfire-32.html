<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer you&#8217;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:28">1:28</a> How can I achieve HTML includes or imports without using any php or javascript? I know that Codekit has a Kit language that can do this but I don&#8217;t have a mac yet. Is there a HTML preprocessors that can do this? If so, can I use only the import function and still use regular HTML on it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=8:56">8:56</a> Picture this: Client organization has a CMS and puts all their ‘news’ content in. Monthly they need to generate a paper newsletter… They push ONE BUTTON and a multi-page pdf, at least as beautiful as the site, is generated with all of their news content… Has anyone tried this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:03">17:03</a> What&#8217;s the best way to compress a vector graphic from Illustrator for the web? There used to be a SVG option for &#8220;Save for Web and Devices&#8221; but it&#8217;s gone in CS6. What SVG specs are best to use?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:43">22:43</a> I&#8217;m starting to hear the phrase &#8220;Tech Bubble&#8221; a lot and it&#8217;s very disheartening. Do you guys believe we&#8217;re in a tech bubble? If so, is it we the web developers/designers who have to worry? Or is it more threatening to investors, entrepreneurs, and 30 y/o billionaires? </li>
<li><a href="#t=32:30">32:30</a> I&#8217;m about to start working at a full time job where the team uses Git. Do you have any advice about workflow or etiquette?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:34">39:34</a> I&#8217;m a developer at a mid-sized SaaS company and we have a pretty successful product. Our product has an API and there are several other companies that sell web site integrations &amp; 3rd party plugins to our customers. Our company even receives fees to recommend certain &#8220;preferred partners&#8221;. Do you think it would be unethical or a conflict of interest for me to develop my own premium WordPress plugin on my own time?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:47">47:47</a> I&#8217;m currently working in a project and the design calls for use of full-screen image backgrounds, in order to optimize this for mobile devices I&#8217;m using media queries to call the appropriate background, it works like a charm, however there is something that bothers me, if I resize the window there&#8217;s a small bit of time where the webpage has no background while the image get&#8217;s loaded. Any way around this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:51">51:51</a> Why aren&#8217;t box-shadow and text-shadow shorthand properties like background and font? Why don&#8217;t the properties box-shadow-color, box-shadow-offset, etc. exist?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:09">58:09</a> My question is about Print Stylesheets. Are they still relevant? How do you approach them?</li>
</ul>
