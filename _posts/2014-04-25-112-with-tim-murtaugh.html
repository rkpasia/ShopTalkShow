title: '112: With Tim Murtaugh'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Tim Murtaugh, you might know him as the guy who helped make the A List Apart website&#8230;</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=13:05">13:05</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/trim/id620775554?mt=8">Trim</a> </li>
<li><a href="#t=16:22">16:22</a> <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener">How to be an Open Source Gardener</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=25:48">25:48</a> Why you would use GitHub over BitBucket when the private repos on BitBucket are clearly cheaper? </li>
<li><a href="#t=32:08">32:08</a> How do you prescribe handling various content styles within a given module? Things like font size, color, and bottom margins? </li>
<li><a href="#t=40:34">40:34</a> Do you think that certificates are of value when looking for a job? Is it worth finding and completing courses that &#8216;verify&#8217; the assortment of web-related skills that I have? </li>
<li><a href="#t=45:10">45:10</a> I came across this website <a href="http://unfold.no/">www.unfold.no</a> and I was wondering: how did they make their website scroll infinitely around in a circle?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:24">50:24</a> Safari Reader &#8211; how does it determine the relative content and what to display and at what article length does it kick in? </li>
<li><a href="#t=56:15">56:15</a> I saw this new bootstrap theme/framework that has dozens of pre-made components that you combine like a puzzle to create a website. This looks pretty good at first on how they present it in their video but when I started using it I was disappointed and it took away the fun of making a website. What are your thoughts about buying and editing themes</li>
</ul>
