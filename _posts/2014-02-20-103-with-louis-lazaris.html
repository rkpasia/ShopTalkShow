---

<p>This week we were joined by Louis Lazeris. Louis is the curator of the <a href="http://webtoolsweekly.com/">Web Tools Weekly</a> email newsletter, co-author of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/store/html5-css3-for-the-real-world/">HTML5 &amp; CSS3 for the Real World</a> and author of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/store/jump-start-css/">Jump Start CSS</a>.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=8:54">8:54</a> <a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/w3schools-ugly-bad-good/">w3schools: The Ugly, the Bad, and the Good</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=20:54">20:54</a> Is there any good solution on how to run page specific javascript functions? </li>
<li><a href="#t=28:50">28:50</a> Question for Louis: Read your recent article on w3schools, but the question remains why their site still loads fast despite that many javascript file requests. Could you try to elaborate on this a bit more?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:35">35:35</a> I&#8217;m interested in finding out what you think of &#8220;mobiledetect&#8221; a php class for device detection: http://mobiledetect.net/. I&#8217;m looking into solutions for swapping out/removing blocks of content (beyond what can be achieved with media queries) on small screen devices and this seems like it could do the job nicely. My main question is, how reliable are solutions like this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:15">48:15</a> Have you come across any solutions to the Windows font icon problem or font smoothing in general?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:40">55:40</a> I&#8217;m enjoying learning Sass, but one of those things I can&#8217;t wrap my head around is use cases for lists. What would you stuff in a Sass list?</li>
</ul>
