title: '083: With Florian Motlik'
---

<p>This week we were joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/flomotlik">Florian Motlik</a>. Flo is an awesome programmer an a co-founder of <a href="https://www.codeship.io/">Codeship</a>, a part of <a href="http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/boston/">Techstars Boston</a>. This episode is a deep dive into continuous deployment and automation.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=13:08">13:08</a> I would like to use Git for version control, and set up a deployment strategy so I can stop going &#8220;FTP commando’, but terminal is a bit scary for me. Do you have any suggestions for free or one-off-purchase alternatives for deployment so I can get off FTP?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:50">20:50</a> Hey guys, I just did a little google-ing and found an <a href="http://www.stephenradford.me/blog/tutorials/deploy-via-bitbucket-or-github-service-hooks">FTP-post-commit-deploy-script for Bitbucket/Github</a>. It works on public and private repos. I set it up on my server for a little project I’m working on, and so far it’s working great! I thought this could be a good tool for folks that don’t have a VPS they can setup Git on to still get on a version control work flow.</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:40">22:40</a> What’s the best way to handle database synching? Is it possible to do it with version control?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:09">40:09</a> I have this site to build with about 30 pages, all one template. Where the line is drawn for static sites vs. CMS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:27">52:27</a> I have been looking at several PaaS options out there such as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://www.appfog.com/">Appfog</a>, <a href="https://pagodabox.com/">Paogdabox</a>, and <a title="Fort Rabit" href="http://fortrabbit.com/" target="_blank">Fortrabbit</a>. I was wondering if those types of scalable web application platforms are best used for all types of sites (blogs for example) since they provide a level of control and scalability, or are they really just meant to be utilized on custom web applications that do a lot of processing server side?</li>
