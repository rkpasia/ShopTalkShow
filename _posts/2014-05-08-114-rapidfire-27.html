<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &amp; answer action.</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:53">1:53</a> How do I integrate GitHub into a real web publishing workflow? </li>
<li><a href="#t=6:40">6:40</a> I find typography on the web always looks somehow chunky. That&#8217;s why I use the webkit prefixed font-smoothing: antialiased on every project I work on to make it look nice and crisp at least for some users. Is there a major problem with this feature that I&#8217;ve missed or any other good reason why developers don&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t use it? </li>
<li><a href="#t=12:15">12:15</a> I&#8217;ve been messing around with the new Flexslider 2 Beta, and I wanted to pull photos from Flickr and use it as a responsive photo gallery. However, the layout breaks and has excessive white space when Flexslider tries to account for portrait oriented images. Is there a way to use intrinsic ratios like with FitVids to get rid of the excess white space? </li>
<li><a href="#t=18:30">18:30</a> It seems like with responsive design it&#8217;s becoming acceptable to use &#8220;foreground images&#8221; (images IN the markup) as banner images so that they can be scaled down as the viewport narrows. Is this acceptable now? </li>
<li><a href="#t=22:15">22:15</a> If you use media queries to adjust the body font-size percentage, is there any rule to figuring out the adjustments to the percentage as you go along? </li>
<li><a href="#t=26:24">26:24</a> What do you guys use for Style Guide Generation? </li>
<li><a href="#t=27:50">29:00</a> Do you guys wear pants while recording Shoptalk shows? </li>
<li><a href="#t=28:40">29:49</a> Any thoughts on Condoleezza Rice joining Dropbox? </li>
<li><a href="#t=29:40">30:51</a> Do you know any good javascript techniques to create pdf files? </li>
<li><a href="#t=31:54">33:00</a> Why SCSS over LESS? </li>
<li><a href="#t=35:36">36:42</a> What do you guys think about the difference between a self taught web designer and a designer with a degree? </li>
<li><a href="#t=38:13">39:23</a> What are your thoughts about working for clients vs working on products? </li>
<li><a href="#t=42:57">44:07</a> Do you have any tips about using Codekit and MAMP for local WordPress development?</li>
