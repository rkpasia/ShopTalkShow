<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li>The type attribute and links &#8211; could browsers affect request headers and thus the content served from the same URL?</li>
<li>Do websites using the .mobi TLD render differently on iOS? (We say on the show probably not, <a href="http://www.davidroessli.com/logs/2010/04/safari_ignores_viewport_mobi_domains/">but&#8230;</a>)</li>
<li>What is Flexbox actually doing to do for us, on a practical level?</li>
<li>How can we get client approval when they are constantly throwing up road blocks and steamrolling good designs?</li>
<li>What does &#8220;Front End Web Developer&#8221; actually mean? Do they need to know back end stuff as well?</li>
