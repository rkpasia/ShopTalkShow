<li><a href="#t=12:11">(12:11)</a> How do you deal with sorting a responsive data table?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:32">(17:32)</a> How do we stay motivated?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:43">(22:43)</a> How do you implement responsive images in WordPress?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:53">(28:53)</a> What is the best way to load checkbox states from a database in an Ajax-y app?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:22">(33:22)</a> Why are we polyfilling media queries for IE 8 and below?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:55">(36:55)</a> Is there a way get Sass to output all media queries at the end of the document rather than peppered througout?</li>
</ul>
