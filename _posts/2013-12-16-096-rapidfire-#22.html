<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:02">2:02</a> Should I use &#8220;.mainNav&#8221; or &#8220;nav.main&#8221;? Do you see any issues with using either?</li>
<li><a href="#t=4:54">4:54</a> I&#8217;m looking to find a new job. How should I approach employers when I&#8217;m not proud of the sites I&#8217;ve been working on?</li>
<li><a href="#t=7:18">7:18</a> I am developing locally and pushing out to a live site but is there an easy way to handle databases (WordPress mainly). Is there a more automated way to do this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:00">12:00</a> How do you design for touch? Do you use something <a href="http://ngryman.sh/jquery.finger/">jQuery.finger</a>?</li>

<li><a href="#t=22:59">22:59</a> Do you think that in the future someone could create program like Photoshop with an export function that compiles everything into cutting-edge code that works on all browsers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:20">27:20</a> What do you guys think of working with coffeescript, less, etc. along with task runners like grunt? Do you find these tedious or too confusing?</li>
