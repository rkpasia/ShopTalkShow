title: '094: With Emily Dunkle'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Emily Dunkle. Emily is a UI &amp; UX Designer from Massachusetts. She believes in semantic markup, design of all kinds, and a good old-fashioned legal pad.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=16:37">16:37</a> My company&#8217;s IT department has taken over our website. What can I do about it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:03">25:03</a> Just wondered what approach you guys take to testing your sites. Not just design, but also functionality and calculations etc. Do you write tests or use any nice tools?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:55">32:55</a> Will Macaw (and similar tools) replace web designers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:40">42:40</a> I have been a web developer for 4 years and I recently built a site for a client that is by far the worst I have built in my career. Should I intentionally ignore best practices just because the client doesn&#8217;t understand and wants the web to work like it did in 2001? </li>
<li><a href="#t=51:00">51:00</a> I would like to get your opinion and thoughts on how to better interact with other developers who either don&#8217;t care or don&#8217;t have an understanding for why and how you have laid out your markup the way you have.</li>
<li><a href="#t=57:05">57:05</a> What is the best responsive solution for image/video galleries? I need my work to be easily accessible on mobile. My problem is that most websites use lightboxes and this seems outdated now. What are your opinions?</li>
</ul>
