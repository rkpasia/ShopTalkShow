<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &amp; answer action.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:08">2:08</a> I have a question about running Sass in a corporate environment. I&#8217;m really interested in using Sass at work but since it requires Ruby there&#8217;s no chance of running a ruby server on my system. Is there any way to run a Sass processor from a thumb drive?</li>
<li><a href="#t=7:48">7:48</a> How long does it take for you to write a blog post from the first day you experience the problem (or get the initial idea of what want to write about) to when you actually hit the publish button?</li>
<li><a href="#t=16:42">16:42</a> Are there any good low cost alternatives to Engine Yard or Heroku for hosting test or small web apps?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:20">22:20</a> What is the best way to validate html and css?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:45">32:45</a> Are there any WordPress shopping carts that have a token feature or do you know of another way to accomplish this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:02">41:02</a> Is it worth offering IE6/7/8 support for a responsive design project?</li>
</ul>
