title: '093: RAPIDFIRE #21'
---

<p>This week, it&#8217;s another RAPID FIRE!!! Chris and Dave take on listener questions, fast and furious.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:21">2:27</a> Do you guys have any advice when the time comes to hand over a WordPress site?</li>
<li><a href="#t=5:57">5:57</a> What are your opinions about disabilities (hopefully about stuttering but not necessary) in the workplace?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:06">9:06</a> How do I address responsiveness on items that don&#8217;t scale well (table, video embeds)?</li>
<li><a href="#t=14:15">14:15</a> What is Grunt.js? What do I use it for?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:37">17:37</a> I was wondering what your opinions are on training from places like MakerSquare (in Austin), G-School (in Denver) and others that say they can teach you to become a developer in a relatively short amount of time. Would you consider attending schools like these?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:14">21:14</a> I&#8217;m looking to start a video blog and I&#8217;m searching for a CMS to use with my static site which I designed and developed. Do you have any experience or thoughts about Leaf CMS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:17">25:17</a> Lately I&#8217;ve just been frustrated with all the work needed to make WordPress speedy. The Admin Dashboard in particular can be so slow at times. Any hot tips to make WordPress snappy?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:35">28:35</a> So we&#8217;ve just launched a startup, what&#8217;s the best way for us to get the app / platform out there, and get people using it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:28">34:28</a> I am yet a CSE undergrad student. I like both C++ and CSS. I like native programming and front end programming. Will I have to choose one or can I do both? </li>
<li><a href="#t=37:56">37:56</a> What are your opinions about Oracle ADF?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:00">42:00</a> Does it make sense to use sprites in your workflow when your image folder is broken up into 2 or more sub folders?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:40">44:40</a> Could you talk a bit about Custom Elements (web components) and why they are (or aren&#8217;t) a good idea? Won&#8217;t they dilute the semantic value of already existing elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:20">48:20</a> Have you investigated switching your local development to AMPPS? I know you have been a big MAMP Pro fan, but I&#8217;ve been reading that it&#8217;s stale and AMPPS has a lot of activity. Thoughts?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:31">52:31</a> It&#8217;s 2013. What&#8217;s up with with setting type in pixels, ems and rems, or even %. I understand the differences in theory, but in practice, I really only use pixels. I get that pixels are static (not relative) and don&#8217;t really mean much with today&#8217;s high-dpi screens, etc. Do I need to suck it up and just get comfy with a modern approach to type, or are pixels ok?</li>
<li><a href="#t=57:30">57:30</a> What SASS pre-processor do you suggest to use on a windows machine to replace Compass and Code Kit?</li>
</ul>
