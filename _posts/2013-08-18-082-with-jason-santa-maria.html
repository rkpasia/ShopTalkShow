title: '082: With Jason Santa Maria'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Jason Santa Maria, a designer currently in Brooklyn, New York. You might know Jason from his work on <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a> or more recently the writing collaboration tool <a href="https://editorially.com/">Editorially</a>. Or perhaps from past work like the WordPress logo and from working at renowned web studio Happy Cog. We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=14:31">14:31</a> WebKit now supports the srcset attribute on image (img) elements &#8211; <a href="https://www.webkit.org/blog/2910/improved-support-for-high-resolution-displays-with-the-srcset-image-attribute/">Webkit.org</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=20:53">20:53</a> Jason, you were one of the more prominent art-direction bloggers with your v4 redesign. Did you find it hampered your writing since you had the extra burden of laying out the article in addition to crafting the words?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:21">26:21</a> What&#8217;s your favorite upcoming part of the CSS Fonts Module Level 3 and can you explain what attracts you to those parts and give a little info/background about that portion of the spec?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:15">30:15</a> Should I chase money, or chase opportunity? I recently could have taken a high-paying corporate job, but chose instead to stay with my creative agency job. What would you do?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:37">35:37</a> I&#8217;ve recently applied for a few jobs where mobile web development or responsive design was a requirement. I started using Twitter Bootstrap about a year ago and use it for every project that I work on now. The feedback that I&#8217;ve received from employers is that their IT team feels that I&#8217;m just using simple templates and that I don&#8217;t have the coding skills or chops required for the position. Does the IT team know what they are talking about?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:05">41:05</a> If I post code on Github and someone makes my code better or fix any bugs, is it legal to make a profit on their own code if I post it on an app store?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:44">47:44</a> How do I become a designer? </li>
</ul>
