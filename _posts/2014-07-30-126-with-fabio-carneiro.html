title: '126: With Fabio Carneiro'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Fabio Carneiro. Fabio is an Email &amp; User Experience Designer at <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>, where he designs and develops versatile, responsive html emails for over 4 million users.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=21:50">21:50</a> Are there any tools or frame works to help make responsive emails easier for me?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:06">38:06</a> Can you describe your workflow for marking up and testing a HTML email?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:58">44:58</a> If you were an active member in a forum, how could you describe the notification preferences of your dreams?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:40">49:40</a> What is the easiest way of handling data without a database?</li>
<li><a href="#t=53:11">53:11</a> I&#8217;ve noticed that most registration forms don&#8217;t require the user to enter their email address twice (just like the password). Is there any best practice to make it the most comfortable for the client and securing a successful registration process?</li>
</ul>
