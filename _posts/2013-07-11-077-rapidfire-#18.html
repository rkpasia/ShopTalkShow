<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE! We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:23">2:23</a> I recently ran the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation</a> tool on one of my WordPress site. I was amazed to see how many errors came up&#8230; Do you have any suggestions for validating my markup?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:19">9:19</a> Should I learn <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> or <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> to speed up writing HTML?</li>
<li><a href="#t=14:47">14:47</a> Do you know of any good tutorials or resources that explain how to set up a workflow for WordPress using GitHub for version control? (Yes: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/">The Lodge</a> at <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="http://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/?utm_source=shoptalkshow.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=shoptalkshowad">WP Migrate DB Pro</a>)</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:40">23:40</a> I was wondering if you know of a way to synchronize break points values between different assets? Is there a way to set the breakpoint values in some way so that both Sass and JS can load them in and use them?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:45">27:45</a> Whenever I use SVGs as a <code>background-image</code> and add the <code>background-size</code> property, the SVG in Firefox is blurry. I&#8217;ve tried fixing this several ways, including making the width and height of the SVG 100%, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to work in every case. Have you ever run into this problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:48">30:48</a> Do you follow any specific style guides for personal/team coding? (<a href="http://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/">Yes: Sass Style Guide</a>)</li>

<li><a href="#t=39:48">39:48</a> I was wondering if you had any advice for what should go into every .htaccess file &#8211; do you have a standard that gets put into every project? I heard some talk about the one included in the HTML5 boilerplate, and took a look, but a lot of it didn&#8217;t really mean anything to me, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what to take&#8230;or should I just take it all?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:32">46:32</a> I have a question for you: What is the best way to create column layouts in CSS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:15">56:15</a> In order to use em and rem better, I declare <code>html {font-size: 62.5%;}</code> so that the root size is 10px. This allows me to do mathematical calculations much easier and faster. (For eg., a 15px font size can be declared as font-size: 1.5rem;). However, this doesn&#8217;t work when it comes to using <code>em</code> in media queries. I&#8217;ve noticed that for these to work correctly, I have to revert back to the default 16px. So a <code>min-width: 1000px</code> will be the inconsistent <code>min-width: 62.5em</code> instead of 100em. Do you guys know of a fix for this? Should I even be using em for media queries?</li>
<li><a href="#t=61:35">61:35</a> In one of your previous episodes you talked a little about <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx</a>, and I was hoping you could talk more about that. In the little that I read, it seems like it&#8217;s much faster than Apache. But are there any catches? Or is it a no-brainer to switch from Apache?</li>
<li><a href="#t=66:56">66:56</a> Could you talk about using Normalize with Compass on Sass? What is your workflow for getting started?</li>
