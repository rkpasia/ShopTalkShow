title: '110: With Julie Ann Horvath'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Julie Ann Horvath, designer and developer for &amp;yet. Julie has recently been the subject of tech news headlines because of her public resignation from her previous employer (Github) due to sexism and harassment. It&#8217;s a heavy and traumatic topic, but we&#8217;re thankful to Julie for sharing her experience so we can grow as a community and prevent these types of unfortunate events in the future.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>

<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=38:09">38:09</a> Do you have any advice on where to look for jobs where an experienced front-end developer could learn from their co-workers and be challenged? </li>
<li><a href="#t=46:52">46:52</a> Since there are a lot of web development languages to learn and many developers know the usual HTML, CSS and Javascript. Which language would you say is a niche market to learn for hire? </li>
