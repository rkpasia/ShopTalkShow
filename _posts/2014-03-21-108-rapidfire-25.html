<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=10:00">10:00</a> If a freelance client wants an eCommerce solution, what is the best way to handle this? </li>
<li><a href="#t=17:15">17:15</a> If I set the font-weight on a parent element that doesn&#8217;t generally support text nodes (like <code>TR</code> or <code>UL</code> tags) the property can be inherited by the child <code>TD</code> or <code>LI</code>. However, if the property is set by another selector (even a less specific one), it&#8217;s replaced. What&#8217;s the deal? </li>
<li><a href="#t=26:09">26:09</a> How you organize variables for preprocessors? </li>
<li><a href="#t=32:30">32:30</a> I wanted to get your method of tackling web projects. What kind of planning goes into your personal processes? </li>
<li><a href="#t=40:05">40:05</a> I am considering getting into some collaborative development through Github. Is Github&#8217;s Explore the best place to start to find projects, or would you recommend another site for finding projects? </li>
<li><a href="#t=48:36">48:36</a> Is it semantically accurate to place pagination or breadcrumbs inside a nav element? </li>
<li><a href="#t=51:55">51:55</a> Is it a good idea to wrap function calls, which trigger Layout (consecutive read->write), in request animation frame? </li>
<li><a href="#t=56:28">56:28</a> I was wondering if you guys could talk about using ajax requests to dynamically load content on a page, and how it can be done so that google can recognize it?</li>
