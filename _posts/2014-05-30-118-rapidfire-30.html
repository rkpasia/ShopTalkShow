<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &amp; answer action.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:48">1:48</a> I have a question(s) about loading JS files in a WordPress environment. Is there a rule of thumb for when async should be utilized? If I script is loaded in the footer does &#8216;async&#8217; not matter as much?</li>
<li><a href="#t=7:50">7:50</a> What software do you two use to create your slides for when you do talks at conferences?</li>
<li><a href="#t=15:50">15:50</a> I have a question about deciding on a development stack. What are some of your recommendations when making these kinds of decisions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:12">29:12</a> Why use static site generators? Are there any good tutorials out there for those of us who have never used one before?</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:28">34:28</a> Is there a way to make a line of text fill the width of a parent container as if it were justified?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:28">38:28</a> In job advertisements I&#8217;ve been seeing lately, all of the best jobs have Angular JS listed as one of the requirements. I really love creating websites that work everywhere. The idea of using the latest tech at the expense of accessibility, and progressive enhancement doesn&#8217;t sit well with me. How can I keep my career advancing, while maintaining those core beliefs?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:45">43:45</a> How long does it normally take you guys to build a website from start to finish, for instance microsoft.com or css-tricks.com?</li>
</ul>
