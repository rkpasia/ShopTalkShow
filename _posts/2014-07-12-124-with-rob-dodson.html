<p>This week we were joined by Rob Dodson. Rob works on Polymer at Google. True Facts. We take a deep dive with him into Polymer and Web Components.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=27:58">27:58</a> Web components are a hot topic at the moment, and it looks like libraries like Polymer are almost ready for production. Have either of you guys had the opportunity to play around with web components yet? Do you think they are the future? What do you believe to be positive and negative aspects of breaking up your HTML, CSS and JavaScript into isolated bundles of styling/functionality?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:58">39:58</a> What would you say are the advantages of polymer over angular directives?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:40">46:40</a> Is it possible to use Polymer with Phonegap?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:09">49:09</a> When working on a project with a team, using Git and SASS, what does your guys folder structure and workflow look like?</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:38">54:38</a> I&#8217;ve started using Grunt for javascript concat and minification, image optimization and cache manifest generation when necessary. Should I .gitignore the node modules folder?</li>
</ul>
