---

<p>This week we were joined by <a href="http://nimbupani.com/">Divya Manian</a>, an &#8220;Open Web Pamphleteer&#8221; at Adobe and <a href="http://garann.com/">Garann Means</a>, a web developer at Etsy and fellow Austinite with Dave. Together they from <a href="http://fripfrap.io/">Frip Frap</a>, a video podcast about front end stuff. That&#8217;s right, #CROSSOVER! We talk about (roughly in order): News&#8217;n&#8217;Links&#8217;n&#8217;Drama<br />
*   WordPress vs Envato drama. Two second recap: Envato sells WP themes with a split license, WordPress doesn&#8217;t like that, no solution in sight, Envato authors can&#8217;t participate (beyond attending) at WordCamps. Jake Caputo was <a href="http://www.designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed">majorly affected</a>. Chris Wallace is <a href="http://chris-wallace.com/2013/01/22/wordpress-wordcamp-and-the-gpl-license/">similarly confused</a>.<br />
*   Heather Arthur <a href="http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/">gets some scorn she didn&#8217;t deserve</a>. Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you get started JavaScript testing?</li>
<li>What does Git have over SVN?</li>
<li>Does a search form belong in a<br />
<nav>?</li>
<li>Is hiding content off screen (rather than display: none;) going to hurt your SEO?</li>
<li>
<p>What up with validation flagging so many &#8220;errors&#8221;? Sponsors</p>
