title: '044: With Jeffrey Zeldman'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Jeffrey Zeldman, a man who scarcely needs an introduction around these parts. In the early days of the web Jeffery was influential in pushing web standards forward and getting us to the happy place we are in now. He&#8217;s also the man behind the web magazine <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>, the web conference An Event Apart, and the book label A Book Apart. We talk about (roughly in order): #HOTDRAMA<br />
*   <a href="?t=9:23">(9:23)</a> &#8211; Harry Roberts mentions (among other things) that <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/">ID&#8217;s are no good.</a> Jeffrey <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2012/11/21/in-defense-of-descendant-selectors-and-id-elements/">defends them</a>. We all have our <a href="http://css-tricks.com/a-line-in-the-sand/">own thoughts</a> &#8211; but agree that dogma == bad. Q &amp; A</p>
