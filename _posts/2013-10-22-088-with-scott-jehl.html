<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=24:30">24:30</a> I want to use a &#8216;mobile first&#8217; approach, but the client wants to see the desktop version first. How would you solve this little problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:14">31:14</a> I&#8217;m trying to understand Javascript templating. I&#8217;ve heard of Mustache/Handlebars, but not sure how it&#8217;s implemented. What are the pros/cons of it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:58">42:58</a> I manage an established, spaghetti-coded academic department website. A redesign is on its way but the menu is still hover based. I needed a quick, temporary fix.</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:43">51:43</a> My question is about vanilla javascript performance and libraries. What if you already have jQuery running, should you still write as much as possible in plain javascript?</li>
