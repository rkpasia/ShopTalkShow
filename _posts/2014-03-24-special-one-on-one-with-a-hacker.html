title: 'Special: One on One with a Hacker'
---

<p>His fake name is &#8220;Earl Drudge&#8221;, an anagram of &#8220;Drug Dealer&#8221;. In early March 2014, he used some social engineering techniques and fake US federal documents to be granted full access to Chris&#8217; servers. After missing the opportunity and a failed retaliation attempt, he posted sensitive personal information of Chris&#8217; onto a site where not only can it never be removed, if it&#8217;s attempted to be removed becomes promoted.</p>
<p>He agreed to talk with Chris directly and have it recorded for this show.</p>
<p>We realize that this crosses the line of &#8220;feeding the trolls&#8221; or giving attention to &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, but we feel it relevant for our industry. Our lives and work are completely online and we&#8217;re all highly susceptible to types of hacks and identity theft. It should go without saying that you should not try to be a hero here: if you visit EarlDrudge&#8217;s site(s), try to expose his identity, or try to snoop around on him, you might actually put yourself in a position where you yourself might be vulnerable to being attacked. We advise you to simply listen.</p>
<p><strong>Update since the recording (from Chris)</strong>: I was able to talk with Media Temple directly only hours after this conversation. One good end result is that they have changed their policy of how/when/what documents can be approved in which to grant access and who can do that. The retaliation attempt (&#8220;honeypot&#8221;) was verified to have been done by Media Temple. They were trying to catch the bad guy for me, and while I wish there was better communication about that, it&#8217;s nice to know they were trying to fight back on my behalf.</p>
