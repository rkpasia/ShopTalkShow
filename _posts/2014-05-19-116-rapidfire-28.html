<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &amp; answer action.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:47">1:47</a> Could you recommend any good WordPress plugins to work with for a bilingual support?</li>
<li><a href="#t=10:38">10:38</a> Is it possible to have a single page website perform well in terms of SEO?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:03">19:03</a> When starting from scratch on a smaller site I tend to work first on the markup, then once happy I begin the styling. This usually means going through all selectors in the DOM and pasting them into the stylesheet. Have you found a tool to scan a DOM and spit out all the classes (and maybe IDs) for styling with?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:12">25:12</a> How should I handle vertical rhythm? </li>
<li><a href="#t=33:18">33:18</a> Have you guys had any luck using MAMP on Mountain Lion?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:07">35:07</a> I&#8217;m having problems with version control. Do you have any advice?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:49">42:49</a> When or why it would be better to use @extend in certain instances versus creating a mixin and using @include?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:15">49:15</a> My client expects pixel perfection when translating PSD to website. What do you think is a reasonable level of fidelity to the mockup to expect from a developer?</li>
<li><a href="#t=57:51">57:51</a> In responsive web design, what are the advantages and disadvantages of including media queries &#8220;inline&#8221; in your CSS versus putting them in separate CSS files?</li>
</ul>
