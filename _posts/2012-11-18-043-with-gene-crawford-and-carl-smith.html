title: '043: With Gene Crawford and Carl Smith'
---

<p>Another CROSSOVER episode! This time the business detectives over at the <a href="http://unmatchedstyle.com/bizcraft">BizCraft show</a> (Gene Crawford and Carl Smith) join us to solve the toughest unsolved mysteries on the modern web. Translation: we hang out with Gene and Carl and do some Q&amp;A. Both of these fellas run their own little web empires doing client work. Carl runs nGen Works and Gene runs Period Three. We talk about (roughly in order): Q &amp; A<br />
*   How do you get a job working remotely?<br />
*   How do you handle a client overage right before launch time?<br />
*   How do you deal with charging for time when you get super into a project and spend way more hours on it than you could charge for it?<br />
*   Local SEO went down, international SEO went up. What up with that?<br />
*   I&#8217;m not feeling my own portfolio, how can I get a job?<br />
*   Should we always be learning new design techniques like we learn coding techniques?<br />
*   What is the proper usage of ems? (<a href="http://css-tricks.com/why-ems/">Why Ems?</a>) Sponsors</p>
