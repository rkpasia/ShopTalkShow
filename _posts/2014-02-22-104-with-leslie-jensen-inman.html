title: '104: With Leslie Jensen-Inman'
---

<p>This week we were joined by Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman, headmaster of <del>Hogwarts</del> the Unicorn Institute (aka Center Centre) in Chattanooga, TN.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=26:50">26:50</a> Firefox 26 now supporting audio decoding</li>
</ul>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=29:20">29:20</a> Will Center Centre have online classes?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:34">30:34</a> Do you guys have any experience with the WordPress plug-in WP Migrate DB Pro?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:40">33:40</a> For Center Centre: are all prospective 30 courses mandatory, or are there electives? Are all courses consecutive or is summer open to intern/work with partner companies?Also, what&#8217;s the target size for the first cohort, what&#8217;s the cost of the program, who are the partner companies, and when can I apply?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:10">43:10</a> I totally hate my job. I&#8217;m therefore trying to turn myself into a freelance developer/designer. Can I acquire the skills I need purely by online and book based learning?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:48">46:48</a> I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be working as a Community Manager for an advertising agency taking care of social media and web development. Recently the job has grown too large and is being split in two and I am opting to stay with the development side and we will bring in a new social person. I have been asked to provide a possible job title. Do you have any more suggestions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:29">52:29</a> I have owned a small web design company for a few years now. I have reached a point where I just need more of a challenge. I would really love to work with a new start up, or maybe just a larger web firm with more exciting clients, but I really have no clue of how to get my foot in the door. Any suggestions?</li>
